## Package graph

```
core  <- backends/excalidraw, backends/fake, sidecar, adapters/mcp, app (types only)
adapters/server <- core, backend-excalidraw, backend-fake, mcp
adapters/cli    <- core, mcp (spawns server/src/main.ts by path; no import)
test/parity, eval <- anything
```

Enforced three ways: each package's `package.json` (Bun's isolated linker only
links declared deps, so undeclared imports do not resolve), `tsconfig.json`
project references (`tsc -b` fails on cycles and on files outside a project),
and `no-restricted-imports` in `eslint.config.js` (`allowedDeps`). Change all
three together. `adapters/mcp` stays core-only for good: server depends on it.

## MCP HTTP transport

`@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0` ships a web-standard Streamable HTTP
transport: `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport`, exported from the package
root, with `handleRequest(req: Request, options?): Promise<Response>`. It plugs
straight into `Bun.serve({ fetch })`, so no express. The same root export also
has `createMcpHandler` (per-request handler factory) and
`validateHostHeader` / `localhostAllowedHostnames` for DNS-rebinding checks.

## TypeScript

- TypeScript is pinned `~6.0.3`: typescript-eslint 8.70 requires
  `typescript <6.1.0`, so 7.x is out until typescript-eslint supports it.
- Every package is `composite` with `emitDeclarationOnly` into `dist/`
  (gitignored). Packages export `./src/index.ts`; Bun and Vite run source,
  `tsc -b` maps imports to the referenced project's `.d.ts`.
- `@total-typescript/ts-reset` is loaded once, via `types` in
  `tsconfig.base.json`, so it applies to every package (a `.d.ts` import in core
  would only reach core's own program).

## Dependencies

New dependencies go through the orchestrator; do not run bun add on a task branch.

## Sidecar

`@elkdraw/sidecar` (`sidecar/src/index.ts`): `new Sidecar(dist = app/dist)`,
`start()` (idempotent; `Bun.serve` on a random 127.0.0.1 port serves the bundle,
headless Chromium loads it and waits for `.excalidraw`), `measure(elements) ->
Box[]`, `snap(bbox, scale = 1) -> Uint8Array` (PNG), `close()`. P0.7: both calls
are stubs (100x40 box per element at the origin; a 1x1 PNG), but they go through
`page.evaluate` and zod validates inputs before the page and outputs after it.

- The app has no headless mode. The sidecar serves no `/ws`, so the app's sync
  client retries every second in the background; harmless for measuring. A
  `?headless=1` flag in `app/` would silence it if that ever matters.
- Timings (M-series Mac, Bun 1.4.2, chromium-1243): cold `start()` ~0.25 s
  (bundle already built); warm `measure`/`snap` 0.3-3 ms. The e2e asserts < 2 s.
- Run: `bun run --cwd elkdraw/sidecar test:e2e` (builds the app, then
  `bun test ./src/sidecar.e2e.ts`). Not part of `check`: it needs `app/dist`.

elkjs under Bun (probe B1, `sidecar/src/elk.test.ts`, runs in `check`): the
bundled build throws (`new _Worker` undefined). This works:

```ts
import ELK from "elkjs/lib/elk-api.js";
const elk = new ELK({
  workerUrl: Bun.resolveSync("elkjs/lib/elk-worker.min.js", import.meta.dir),
});
await elk.layout(graph); // elk-api's default factory: new Worker(url), Bun's Web Worker
elk.terminateWorker();
```

3-node layered layout: ~90 ms including worker start.
